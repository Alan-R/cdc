This project was created to use pure open source software to reproduce the results of a Covid-19 study by
[Dr Genevieve Briand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevieve-briand-6027a514) an
[Assistant Director and Senior Lecturer](https://advanced.jhu.edu/directory/genevieve-briand/)
at Johns Hopkins University.
The original version of this study can be found on the
[wayback machine](
https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19),
and the video of the webinar is (currently)
[on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TKJN61aflI).

Johns Hopkins censored this information and
[explained why](https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19)
on their web site.
It is worth noting that they did not cite any inaccuracies in her results or conclusions,
simply that others might draw the conclusions from it that are inconsistent
with [the narrative](https://sharylattkisson.com/) concerning COVID-19.

If we are able to reproduce her results, then that's how good science should be done.
If we are not able to reproduce her results, then that's _also_ how good science should be done.
Reproducing her efforts using only open source software provides complete transparency.


This project concentrates on solid, provable, factual information related to COVID-19. 

**This project is just beginning**, we have not yet reproduced (or failed to reproduce) her results.
This will likely take a few weeks.


We believe:
 - COVID-19 is a real disease,
 - COVID-19 has killed many people in the US and across the world,
 - Every death caused by COVID-19 is someone's personal tragedy.

This site is not a "COVID-denier" effort.
Attempts to categorize it as such are libel.
